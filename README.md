# ReceiptScannerApp
## Work in progress
It's a java application following the DDD design pattern. It's purpose is to store/manage your receipt  as you want, and extract data from it. I developed this application because I want to manage my personal information regarding my purchases. Ultimately I would have a scanner module that would scan the receipt and add it to the database.
